Welcome to the Google Search Appliance Connector for Lotus Notes!

The Google Search Appliance connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems. An
enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Connector for Lotus Notes provides access to documents and
document metadata stored in the Lotus Domino Server developed by
IBM.

The connector communicates with the Lotus Domino Server using the
Java language Application Programming Interface. To properly
build this connector you will need access to certain components
of the Lotus Notes client or the Lotus Domino Server,
specifically Notes.jar. Lotus Notes and Domino are offered by IBM
and are not included in this distribution.
